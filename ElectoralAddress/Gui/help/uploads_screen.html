		<h1>Manage uploads dialog</h1>
		<p>See the <a href="overview.html">overview</a> for a high level description of address uploads</p>
		<p>This dialog manages upload jobs which generate SQL scripts to
		upload the address updates to Landonline. </p>
		<p>The dialog has two tabs - &quot;create upload&quot; to create new uploads, and &quot;review uploads&quot; to review previous uploads.  This can be used to regenerate previous SQL scripts.

		<p>The create upload tab displays all jobs currently set to completed, for which an upload has not already been generated.</p>
		<p>To create an upload, select the jobs to use in the list, browse to choose a file name for the upload SQL script, and click the &quot;Create&quot; button</p>
