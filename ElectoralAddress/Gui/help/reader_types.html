		<h1>Address reader types</h1>
		<p>The electoral address application can support multiple address reader types - python modules used to extract addresses from supplied data.</p>
		<p>Each reader type is implemented into <a href="overview.html#source_types">data source types</a> by defining <a href="#parameters">parameters</a>, generally to specify which fields in the data source contain the various components of the supplied address.</p>

		<p>Some normalisation of numbers and road names takes place before they are loaded.  They are converted to upper case and trimmed of leading and trailing spaces.  Additionally &quot;STATE&nbsp;HIGHWAY&nbsp;<i>nn</i>&quot; is converted to &quot;SH&nbsp;<i>nn</i>&quot;.


		<h2><a name="OgrReader"></a>The OGR address reader</h2>
		<p>The OGR address reader is usd to read addresses from data files 
		using the OGR simple feature library.  This supports a wide 
		range of geospatial data formats, such as ESRI shape files, 
		MapInfo tab files, and so on.</p>
		<p>The reader extracts the spatial location of the feature from
		the data file, as well as the attributes.</p>
		<p>
		The reader takes the following <a href="#parameters">parameters</a>
		</p>
		<ul class="parameterlist">
			<li>id: Identifies the field(s) containing the suppliers reference for the address.  This is optional</li>
			<li>roadname: Identifies the field(s) containing the roadname of the address</li>
			<li>number: Identifies the field(s) containing the number of the address</li>
			<li>status: Identifies the field(s) containing the supplier status of the address. Currently the only value recognized by the application is 'DELE'.  Any other values are ignored.  This is optional.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2><a name="CsvReader"></a>The CSV address reader</h2>
		<p>The CSV address reader is usd to read addresses from comma separated (CSV) files.  This supports CSV files compatible with Microsoft Excel.  
		It assumes that the first line in the CSV file contains the names
		of the fields in the file.  
		</p>
		<p>The reader extracts the spatial location of the feature from
		the easting and northing coordinates in the  file.</p>
		<p>
		The reader takes the following <a href="#parameters">parameters</a>
		</p>
		<ul class="parameterlist">
			<li>id: Identifies the field(s) containing the suppliers reference for the address.  This is optional</li>
			<li>east: Identifies the field containing the easting or longitude of the address point.</li>
			<li>north: Identifies the field containing the northing or latitude of the address point.</li>
			<li>roadname: Identifies the field(s) containing the roadname of the address</li>
			<li>number: Identifies the field(s) containing the number of the address</li>
			<li>status: Identifies the field(s) containing the supplier status of the address. Currently the only value recognized by the application is 'DELE'.  Any other values are ignored.  This is optional.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2><a name="parameters"></a>Reader type parameters</h2>
		<p>
		Each reader defines parameters which express how information such as the house number, street name, etc are compiled from the data fields in the source file.</p>
		<p>
		The simplest form of parameter is just the name of a field, for example &quot;road_name&quot; will take the value of the road name field.
		</p>
		<p>Literal strings can be returned by including them in double or single quotes in the parameter definition. 
		</p>
		<p>Several fields may be concatenated into a parameter definition by putting them into a list.  Fields separated by just white space in the definition will be separated by whitespace in the resulting value.  Fields separated by &quot;,&quot; will be concatenated without any space.  
		</p>
		<p>
		For example if the definition is &quot;road_name&nbsp;road_type&quot;, then if the road_name field contains "HIGH" and the road_type field contains "STREET", then the value resulting from the definition will be &quot;HIGH&nbsp;STREET&quot;.  Similarly, if the definition is &quot;number,&nbsp;suffix&quot;, number contains &quot;5&quot; and suffix contains &quot;B&quot; then the result will be &quot;5B&quot;.
		</p>
		<p>The definition can also contain the following functions for 
		calculating values from the fields:
		</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td>
					lookup(<i>type</i>,<i>value</i>,<i>default</i>)
				</td>
				<td>
					Returns the result of lookup up <i>value</i> as a code in the &quot;code&quot; database table, where the code_type is specified by <i>type</i>.  If no value matches, then <default> is returned.<br>
					The abbreviation &quot;field/type&quot; can be used instead of &quot;lookup(&quot;type&quot;,field,field)&quot;.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					if(<i>test</i>,<i>value1</i>,<i>value2</i>)
				</td>
				<td>
					Returns <i>value1</i> if <i>test</i> is blank, else <i>value2</i>.
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					replace(<i>pattern</i>,<i>subs</i>,<i>value</i>)
				</td>
				<td>
					Applies a regular expression replacement to the string.  (This uses the python re.sub function - refer to python documentation for details).
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					join(<i>value1</i>,<i>value2</i>,...)
				</td>
				<td>
					Concatenates the strings <i>value1</i>...  This is to use the concatenated strings in other functions.
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
