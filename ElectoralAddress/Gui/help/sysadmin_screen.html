		<p>See the <a href="overview.html">overview</a> for a high level description of address uploads</p>
		<p>The system administration dialog is used to manage the 
		suppliers and formats in which address data are supplied.</p>

		<p>The data sources screen is used to define formats in which 
		data is supplied.  The existing formats can be modifed, and new formats created.  
		Note: if a job is reloaded after modifying the source type or supplier it uses then
		the update source type will be used.
		</p>

		Select the &quot;New&quot; button to create a new data source, 
		&quot;Save&quot; to save changes made, &quot;Cancel&quot; to 
		undo any changes made, and &quot;Delete&quot; to delete a data 
		source.

		<p>
		Each data source has the following attributes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Name: a name used to reference the data source</li>
