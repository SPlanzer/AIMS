		<h1>The address merging dialog</h1>
		<p>See the <a href="overview.html">overview</a> for a high level description of address uploads</p>
		<p>This dialog provides functions for merging supplied addresses into a single address (for example a range of flats), and for unmerging address that have already been merged.  The dialog is accessed from the <a href="addresslinking_screen.html">address linking screen</a>.</p>
		<p>The dialog has two tabs - one for merging addresses and one for unmerging addresses.  The dialog only displays addresses with on the same parcel, and linked to the same road as the current parcel when the dialog was started.
